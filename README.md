## Exploring the computational and functional capabilities of InfluxDB and TimescaleDB

The goal of this project was to develop a deeper understanding of time series databases (tsdbs) and select 2 to compare their computational capabilities and functions.
We wanted to see the differences between a database designed for time series data, and an established database with a timeseries extension.

Tools used:
Time Series Benchmark Suite (TSBS), AWS linux VM, INfluxDB, TimescaleDB
