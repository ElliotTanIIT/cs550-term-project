## Exploring the computational and functional capabilities of InfluxDB and TimescaleDB

The goal of this project is to compare two time series databases: InfluxDB and TimescaleDB. The comparison problem of two databases can be divided into three sections. 

### Section 1
First, the architecture of the databases need to be explored. The architecture of databases helps us to understand how data is stored, and how queries are executed in different databases. 

### Section 2

Second, it is necessary to get to know the unique operational capabilities of the databases. This is also an important section. As we know both InfluxDB and TimescaleDB are popular time series databases on the market. There must be some functional differences between them, and our task is to figure out their unique operation capabilities. 

### Section 3

Third, the computational performance should be evaluated. The performance of a database is very essential. One database may perform variously on different types of queries. Therefore, we need to figure out for InfluxDB and TimescaleDB, which database performs better on what kind of queries. Also, the data insertion performance is an important feature, which needs to be considered in this project.

Please read the official final report for more details.
